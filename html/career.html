        <!-- Intro to my career goals -->
        <article class="article">
           When I first was exposed to concepts of technology, I knew I was entering a 
           vast environment, offering hundreds of career paths that can be incredibly varied. 
           Immediately, I was drawn to project management, as it offers the ability to
           dial up or dial back how technical the PM desires to be.
           In addition, it becomes more evident that technical project management involves
           a lovely balance between strong communication/team oversight and understanding complex,
           technical details - two of my favorite things.
