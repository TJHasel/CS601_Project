              Throughout most of my youth, I focused heavily on my development as a baseball player, traveling
              the country from ages 8 to 21. My main position was Pitcher, where I was able to earn a scholarship to
              the University of California, Berkeley, directly out of High School. I continued to play until my third
              year in college, but decided to leave the sport to focus on academics and advancing career opportunities.

                I've naturally always been a high-velocity thrower, which can lead to batters swinging late and
                often missing. However, it is equally crucial to possess a repertoire of off-speed pitches to challenge the
                batters timing, and thus force them to constantly adjust to the pitches you are providing. This was an aspect
                of my game needed significant improvement.
